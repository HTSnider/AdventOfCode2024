# Day 5: 
The first notable day. I completed the first part using regex to evaluate the following of the ordering rules, which turned out to be completely incompatible with part 2. 
My part 2 is follows the solution of another participant, where the rules of ordering are expressed as which pages must precede each page, and this is used to calculate the minimum index the page must go in the correct ordering, which is then used to sort the update.
